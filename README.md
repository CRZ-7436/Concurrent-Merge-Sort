# Concurrent Merge Sort for CSV Files

A simple GoLang command-line program for sorting a CSV file titled `big-numbers.csv` as quickly as possible using Concurrent Merge Sort algorithm.

## Description

This project demonstrates a GoLang implementation of Concurrent Merge Sort algorithm specifically tailored for sorting large datasets stored in a CSV file. By leveraging Go's concurrency features, the program efficiently sorts the numbers within the CSV file in parallel, resulting in faster sorting times.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- GoLang installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/concurrent-merge-sort.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd concurrent-merge-sort
   ```

### Running the program

1. Place your CSV file titled `big-numbers.csv` containing the list of numbers to be sorted in the project directory.

2. Compile the program:
   ```
   go build .
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```
   ./concurrent-merge-sort
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the sorting process.

## Features

- Concurrent implementation of Merge Sort algorithm optimized for sorting CSV files.
- Efficient handling of large datasets for quick sorting.
- Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
